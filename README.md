Project Title: Electronic Medical Records (EMR) System - Integration with Hospital MIS and Financial System

Description:
This project focuses on developing an Electronic Medical Records (EMR) system and its subsequent integration with a hospitalâ€™s Management Information System (MIS) and Financial System. The EMR system is designed to streamline patient data management, improve healthcare service delivery, and facilitate secure communication between various departments. The integration aims to connect the EMR system with the hospital's financial and MIS systems to enhance data flow, ensure efficient billing, and improve overall hospital operations.

Key Features:
Personalized Patient Templates: Customizable templates that adapt to specific patient conditions, reducing inefficiency and improving data accuracy.
Multi-Department Access: Allows authorized users, such as doctors, nurses, pharmacies, and laboratory departments, to update and access patient records seamlessly.
Patient Portal: Enables patients to log their health data, monitor vital signs, and interact with their medical history.
Efficient Data Registration: Enables quick registration of unregistered patients to maintain a comprehensive patient database.
Data Sharing Across Hospitals: A feature for secure data sharing between hospitals, allowing for collaborative patient care and ensuring access to medical history across locations.
Financial Integration: Syncs patient records with the financial system to streamline billing, payment processing, and insurance claims.
Security & Compliance: Ensures data security through encryption, role-based access control, and compliance with local healthcare regulations.
Scalability & Reliability: Designed to scale with hospital growth, supporting a large number of concurrent users while minimizing downtime.
Documents Included:
Use Cases & Use Case Diagram: Describes functional interactions between users and the system.
User Journeys: Outlines typical user experiences and interactions within the EMR system.
Non-Functional Requirements (NFR): Describes system attributes such as security, scalability, and performance.
Personas: Represents various stakeholders within the system (doctors, nurses, patients, financial team, etc.).
Prioritization: Defines the importance and feasibility of system features.
Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM): Maps requirements to design, development, and testing stages.
Software Requirements Specification (SRS): Comprehensive documentation of system functionalities, performance requirements, and constraints.
